          <p class="card-text">
            Sometimes it takes an artist to reflect an event back at us, so we
            can truly see and feel it. It could be a photo taken by a journalist
            or a witness, like the Falling Man from 9/11. Or it could be a film,
            like Spike Lee’s When the Levees Broke, which brought home the
            reality left in Katrina’s wake. This year, Jon Bon Jovi’s trying to
            show us who we are with his new album 2020, which tackles the
            pandemic, political divisiveness, and police violence, among other
            fractures in the current American landscape. It’s his attempt to, as
            he puts it, “bear witness to history.”

            “Let’s face it, I’m the posterboy for white privilege,” says Jon Bon
            Jovi a few weeks before 2020 is ready to drop. Started long before
            COVID-19 shut down the nation, George Floyd galvanized Black Lives
            Matter and Breonna Taylor’s death and lack of reckoning further
            called into question certain police practices, the once-and-always
            heart throb to generations of arena rock fans realized that the
            album he was making with the band that wears his name, that was
            already leaning into a more cultural awareness than a lot of
            straight-up rock & roll, could be so much more.

          <h5 class="card-title">SPEAKING OUT ON POWERFUL ‘2020’</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            "It's a long way from 'You Give Love A Bad Name' to 'American
            Reckoning.'" Jon Bon Jovi says laughing. Don't misunderstand, tThe
            Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame frontman is very proud of his storied
            past. As he says during our 45-minute Zoom call to discuss the
            band's superb new 2020 album, he stands behind the band's seminal
            hits, like "You Give Love A Bad Name" and "Livin' On A Prayer. But
            now at age 58, he isn't trying to recreate his past. " I said this
            when I was 25, 'When I'm 50 I don't want to be painting my
            fingernails black and writing bitch on my belly,'" he says laughing.
            So on this new album he has written some of the most powerful and
            compelling songs of his storied career, including "American
            Reckoning," which directly references the George Floyd killing this
            past May, and "Lower The Flag," a forceful song about the gun
            violence epidemic in America. I spoke with him about the writing of
            the album, remaining a fan of his heroes, including his friend
            "Beatle Paul," his philanthropic foundation and his favorite
            lyricists.
